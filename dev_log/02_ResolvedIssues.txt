    ISSUE 180511
      Doesn't calculate time properly - looks like it's based on the user createdAt instead of the comment / post / etc.

    ISSUE 180513
      Login page is broken. (error: can't map a value). fairly sure it's due to JSON reformatting earlier today that I forgot to address.

      ISSUE 180513:
        -Friends don't let friends null check in renders. Use default values instead.
        Switching between pages (going into a post, clicking the logo to go back to '/' and going to a new post) breaks esp. on posts made through upload (vs. seed). Don't even know what's up with that. Begin by looking at the upload form I guess and see if there's something weird going on with the uploads in the db.

    ISSUE 180515:
    -resolved itself? Uhhhh. I think I cleared out the votes in the db then reseeded
      -rails db:seed => some crazy jazz about needing to switch production / development environments?
      -- started happening after trying to seed vote comments.

        ISSUE 180511
        -was a few things. Delete wasn't returning properly from the model, comment reducer was set up properly but post reducer was also holding onto state instead of updating so I had to explicitly filter out the old comment id from commentsList
          -comment delete button isn't working -- currently hitting a server error
