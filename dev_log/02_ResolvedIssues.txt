      Doesn't calculate time properly - looks like it's based on the user createdAt instead of the comment / post / etc.

  /session/login_form.jsx
    ISSUE 180513
      Login page is broken. (error: can't map a value). fairly sure it's due to JSON reformatting earlier today that I forgot to address.

  /frontend/components
    /gallery/gallery.jsx
      ISSUE 180513:
        Switching between pages (going into a post, clicking the logo to go back to '/' and going to a new post) breaks esp. on posts made through upload (vs. seed). Don't even know what's up with that. Begin by looking at the upload form I guess and see if there's something weird going on with the uploads in the db.
        -Friends don't let friends null check in renders. Use default values instead.
