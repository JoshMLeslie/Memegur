          update to use receive_nnn_errors instead of RECEIVE_SESSION_ERRORS since it doesn't care about it -- requires building out that whole error child(ren)

        Switching between pages (going into a post, clicking the logo to go back to '/' and going to a new post) breaks esp. on posts made through upload (vs. seed). Don't even know what's up with that. Begin by looking at the upload form I guess and see if there's something weird going on with the uploads in the db.
        -heroku is also throwing some 500-internal server error when I try to upload, so signs even more so point toward that.
