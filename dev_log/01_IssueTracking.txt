        LOW PRIORITY
          update to use receive_nnn_errors instead of RECEIVE_SESSION_ERRORS since it doesn't care about it -- requires building out that whole error child(ren)

        MEDIUM PRIORITY
          comment delete button isn't working -- currently hitting a server error

      HIGH PRIORITY
        Switching between pages (going into a post, clicking the logo to go back to '/' and going to a new post) breaks esp. on posts made through upload (vs. seed). Don't even know what's up with that. Begin by looking at the upload form I guess and see if there's something weird going on with the uploads in the db.
        -heroku is also throwing some 500-internal server error when I try to upload, so signs even more so point toward that.

    /session/login_form.jsx
      HIGH PRIORITY
        Login page is broken. (error: can't map a value). fairly sure it's due to JSON reformatting earlier today that I forgot to address.
