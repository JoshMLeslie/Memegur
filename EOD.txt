END OF DAY REPORTS
180507:
  - login/signup links and forms display on the home page ('/')
  - properly redirects to '/' after login and when logged-in (can navigate directly to '/login' to do so)
  - can manually toss in the 'logout' ajax request to do so
  - bootstrapping c.u. works properly on page reload
  - logout button needs to be dealt with NOT in the app.jsx file. Pain in the ass it is try and slap it in there (needs if(props.currentUser) )
  - had to revert back errors in 'session_actions.js' instead of trying to put them into one 'const' and chain that in. Maybe later.
  - otherwise everything seems to be up and running to this point

180508:
  - a lot of css work done, a lot to be done.
  --spend at most an hour figuring out how to position the damn sign-in form, currently stuck in the middle of the page up its own ass.
  ---look at the NYTimes project
  - Moving onto establishing posts tomorrow (from the db up)
  - refactored header.jsx, feels more readable now. Also converted it from a headless object into a fully fledged class. Wohoo.
  -- dealt with the logout button / displaying username when logged in 'const UserBlock'
  --- logout button works.
