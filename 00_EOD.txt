END OF DAY REPORTS

180510:
-SO LONG ON CSS.
-Added some plugins to atom, which is cool.
--linters, minimap scroll thing, etc.
-90% Built up posts' show page / posts themselves
--missing image link, but will implement with AWS over the weekend(?)
--need to figure out the "show next meme" button
--bootstrapped a scrolling header to the post page. I hate it but whatever. Would prefer a sticky header that jumps after a certain point, but MDN says it's unstable (unsupported 100%)
---having the main header always scrolling is a personal choice because I think it's stupid that it doesn't on the real page.
-building out comments tomorrow

180509:
-Spent so long on CSS today it's awful, but everything is a lot cleaner, so there's that.
-Got the session forms and header all squared away - realized an hour into making a session-form drop-down that Imgur actually just uses separate pages for that. So that happened.
-demo user works, have to manually seed it whenever I make a big change, but whatever. Can address that later.
-working on posts tomorrow, user profile afterwards
--need to ensure redirect to '/' aka 'homepage' on successful login
-- flex boxes for DAYS
-- db: post + image model / controller / json views / etc.
--- got my work cut out for me, which is nice.

180508:
- a lot of css work done, a lot to be done.
--spend at most an hour figuring out how to position the damn sign-in form, currently stuck in the middle of the page up its own ass.
---look at the NYTimes project
- Moving onto establishing posts tomorrow (from the db up)
- refactored header.jsx, feels more readable now. Also converted it from a headless object into a fully fledged class. Wohoo.
-- dealt with the logout button / displaying username when logged in 'const UserBlock'
--- logout button works.

180507:
- login/signup links and forms display on the home page ('/')
- properly redirects to '/' after login and when logged-in (can navigate directly to '/login' to do so)
- can manually toss in the 'logout' ajax request to do so
- bootstrapping c.u. works properly on page reload
- logout button needs to be dealt with NOT in the app.jsx file. Pain in the ass it is try and slap it in there (needs if(props.currentUser) )
- had to revert back errors in 'session_actions.js' instead of trying to put them into one 'const' and chain that in. Maybe later.
- otherwise everything seems to be up and running to this point
